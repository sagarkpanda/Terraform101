## What is Terraform:
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IAC) tool that helps us to safely and predictably provision and manage infrastructure in any cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.

## How if Works:
We write a set of instruction using a declarative DSL called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and TF executes the instructions to get the expected result for us.

The core TF workflow consists of three stages:

<h4> Write: </h4> You define resources, which may be across multiple cloud providers and services. For example, you might create a configuration to deploy an application on virtual machines in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network with security groups and a load balancer.

<h4> Plan: </h4> Terraform creates an execution plan describing the infrastructure it will create, update, or destroy based on the existing infrastructure and your configuration.

<h4> Apply: </h4>

On approval, Terraform performs the proposed operations in the correct order, respecting any resource dependencies. For example, if you update the properties of a VPC and change the number of virtual machines in that VPC, Terraform will recreate the VPC before scaling the virtual machines.

<h4> Destroy: </h4>

Deletes/Removes the resources.
